			<strong>Iconic football stadium!!</strong><br><img src="img1.jpeg" alt="rating 5";>
			<hr>
				It’s definitely worth doing the stadium tour, it’s a fun day out for anyone! You can take your time walking around, take plenty of photos, have a read about the history, theres lots of interactive activities, there’s definitely something for everyone. Would definitely recommend!

			<strong>Bad experience</strong><br><img src="img3.jpeg" alt="rating 4";>
			<hr>
			We Paid 156 euro for 2 Young children 5 years 2 teens at 9 years and for 4 adult. Paid the tickets only at your website. No one mentioning that the same Day you should have a new player presentation so we could Not use the full access of our ticket! Very bad information level of such Club and Company like FC Barcelona.

			<hr>
				I visited the Camp Nou three time my last was in 2019 before the Covid-19, the building is huuuge, and everything was organized very well, even it was a Classico game (Barcelona vs Real Madrid) Everyone who is visiting Barcelona MUST visit the CampNou.
